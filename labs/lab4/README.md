# Lab 4: Isabelle Proof Assistant

In this lab, you will use the Isabelle proof assistant. A contrario to LISA, Isabelle is based on Higher Order Logic (HOL), a typed logical system, and already has development that allows for definitions of recursively defined data structures and functions. You will also be able to use the advanced automation offered by Isabelle.

First start by downloading Isabelle:
https://isabelle.in.tum.de/

And read up to page 25 of http://concrete-semantics.org/concrete-semantics.pdf for a nice introduction and tutorial.

THe assignement consists in writing the following proofs. First, solve exercise 2.10 of http://concrete-semantics.org/concrete-semantics.pdf, which you can write at the begining of the file ProgramsAreRelationsLab.thy, and then fill the missing proof in the reminder of the file.



## Submission
Once you've finished, you can submit your Lab03.scala file [on Moodle](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/assign/view.php?id=1100580) by Wednesday, 16 November 2022, 23:59. You are given 10 days so that you can ask questions if needed during the next exercise session. Only one member of the group needs to submit.
