# Week 8: Background Paper

As a starting point for your goup project, we ask you to read, understand and review a scientific paper related to Formal verification. The choice of the paper should be discussed with us on the exercises sessions of the 4th or 5th November. It is good if the paper you chose support your project, but not necessary and you can decide to change the topic of your project.
You should lock your paper by Saturday 6th of November (23:59). Please send us the title of the paper and pdf by email.

### Review of the background paper

In the following week, you should make sure that you have a good understanding of the paper. Discuss it within your group, and you can also ask us if there is a part of the paper that you don't understand.
Once you have a good understanding of the paper, we ask you to do a summary of the paper, **in your own words**. Present the topic, the results of the paper and sketch how those result are obtained. Your review should be three to five pages long. You can find in this repo a latex template that may help you structure your review.


## Submission
Please submit your review in pdf format [on Moodle](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/assign/view.php?id=1104628) by Saturday, 13 November 2021, 23:59. Only one member of the group needs to submit.
