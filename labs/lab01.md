# Week 1: Course Introduction and Stainless

In this first lab, you will use Stainless to verify programs.

## Installation

Start by installing stainless version 0.9.0 from [this repository](https://github.com/epfl-lara/stainless/releases). The release is an archive containing among other things a binary called stainless, that you should make available in your path. Make sure that you are using Java 8. On some Linux distributions, you can use sudo update-alternatives â€“config java to change versions. 

#### Note for Windows users

As Stainless currently does not work out of the box on Windows, we advise you to run it with either the Windows Subsystem for Linux or a virtual machine running Linux. It may also work with something like Cygwin but this has not been tested yet.
