# Final Lab: Project

The final lab, which carries most points (please see the grading policy), is the group project. Each group chooses its own topic of the project in agreement with the course teaching staff. The following is the link to projects with some suggestions:

You will need to log into gitlab with your EPFL credentials to access it.

## Background Paper choice and Project Abstract

As a starting point for your group project that will span over the reminder of the class, we ask you to read, understand and review a scientific paper related to Formal Verification. The paper you chose should ce related to your planned project, also it is not a problem if the direction of the project changes later.

For example, your project consists in verifying correctness of a certain algorithm or datastructure, a good choice of paper may be one where said algorithm or datastructure is theoretically presented and the corectness is proved. In case of doubt, you are welcome to discuss your choice of project and background paper with the teaching team.

You are also asked to write a brief abstract presenting your project. This abstract should span over approximately 10 lines of text and briefly present the scientific context, the motivation behind the project and what you plan to achieve.

You should lock your paper and the topic of your project by Friday, 1st of November (03:59). Write an abstract briefly presenting your project, and indicate the full reference of your paper of choice in a pdf (we recommend using Latex) and send it to us via [moodle](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/assign/view.php?id=1227669).


## Background Paper Review

You are then asked to write a review of the background paper. A review should be 3 to 5 pages long at most. It is a summary of the most important points of the paper. You should demonstrate that you understood the paper well, and try to convey as much insight as possible about the original paper to the reader of your summary. Note that excessive quoting, or simply filtering the original text, will not be good enough, the review needs to be written **using your own words**. You can use AI tools to correct your grammar, but not to produce entire new sentences.

The most important parts your review should contain are the presentation of the topic, the results, and sketches of how those results where obtained (proof, implementation...). You can find a template giving an approximate structure for such review in the file [template.tex](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lara/cs550/-/blob/main/project/template.tex?ref_type=heads). **Don't fill the template as is in your review** and you don't have to use the exact same sections. It is merely a suggestion of organisation and typical content. In particular, if you use "Body" as the title of any of your sections, you will lose points.

Your Background Paper Review will also need to be submitted on [moodle](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/assign/view.php?id=1104628) before Friday, 8th of November (03:59).
