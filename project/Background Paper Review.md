#Background Paper



##Background Paper choice and Project Abstract

As a starting point for your group project that will span over the reminder of the class, we ask you to read, understand and review a scientific paper related to Formal Verification. The paper you chose should ce related to your planned project, also it is not a problem if the direction of the project changes later.

For example, your project consists in verifying correctness of a certain algorithm or datastructure, a good choice of paper may be on where said algorithm or datastructure is theoretically presented and the corectness is proved. In case of doubt, you are welcome to discuss your choice of project and background paper with the teaching team.

You are also asked to write a brief abstract presenting your project. This abstract should span over approximately 10 lines of text and briefly present the scientific context, the motivation behind the project and what you plan to achieve.

You should lock your paper and the topic of your project by Wednesday, 16th of November (23:59). Write an abstract briefly presenting your project, and indicate the full reference of your paper of choice in a pdf (we recommend using Latex) and send it to us via [moodle](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/assign/view.php?id=1227669).


##Background Paper Review

You are then asked to write a review of the background paper. A review should be 3 to 5 pages long. It is a summary of the most important points of the paper. You should demonstrate that you understood the paper well, and try to convey as much insight as possible about the original paper to the reader of your summary. Note that excessive quoting, or simply filtering the original text, will not be good enough, the review needs to be written {{in your own word}}.
The most important parts your review should contain are the presentation of the topic, the results, and sketches of how those results where obtained (proof, implementation...). You can find a template giving an approximate structure for such review in [template.tex]. {Don't use the template as is in your review} and you don't have to use the exact same sections. It is merely a suggestion of organisation and typical content.

Your Background Paper Review will also need to be submitted on [moodle](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/assign/view.php?id=1104628) before Wednesday, 30th of November (23:59).
