This  repository is the homepage of the course Formal Verification (autumn 2022) and hosts the material necesary for the labs.

### Staff:

- Professor: [Viktor Kunčak](https://people.epfl.ch/viktor.kuncak)
- Teaching Assistant: [Simon Guilloud](https://people.epfl.ch/simon.guilloud)
- Student Assistants: [Noé De Santo](https://people.epfl.ch/noe.desanto), [Andrea Gilot](https://people.epfl.ch/andrea.gilot)

### Grading

The grade is based on the written mid-term, as well as code, documentation, and explanation of projects during the semester. Specific percentages will be communicated in the first class and posted here.

The types of graded materials will include:

- 40% Mid-term: 27 October 15:15-18:00
- 20% total: four labs, to be done in groups, each group working independently on same projects
- 40% final project to be done in groups, you will choose a topic with our agreement
    - 10% Written presentation of a background paper 
    - 10% Results accomplished (how hard it was, how far you got)
    - 10% Presentation of results
    - 10% Final report

# Content

In this course we introduce formal verification as a principled approach for developing systems that do what they should do.

The course has two aspects:
- learning the practice of formal verification - how to use tools to construct verified software
- understanding the principles behind formal verification and the ways in which verification tools work

The course will follow a similar structure to the [2020 edition](https://lara.epfl.ch/w/fv20/top). Project can be a case study in developing a verified piece of software, an implementation of verification tool functionality, or a theoretical result about verification, constraint solving or theorem proving. Students present their projects with a written report as well as by a live presentation of the background material and project results, answering our questions.

Note that slides can be found **underneath each lecture video** on switch tube linkes below.
