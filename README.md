# EPFL CS550 - Formal Verification

[Moodle](https://moodle.epfl.ch/course/view.php?id=13051), [Coursebook](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/formal-verification-CS-550?cb_cycle=bama_cyclemaster&cb_section=in)

This  repository will be the homepage of the course Formal Verification (fall 2021) and host all the material necesary for the labs.

 **Construct 100% correct software!** The course is all project based. 

### Staff:

- Professor: [Viktor Kunƒçak](https://people.epfl.ch/viktor.kuncak)
- Teaching Assistant: [Simon Guilloud](https://people.epfl.ch/simon.guilloud)

### Early Task

The projects will consist in 4 small labs and one larger project. Students should form groups of 2 to 3 by October 1st and send their group to [Simon Guilloud](https://people.epfl.ch/simon.guilloud)

### Grading

- 40% Four labs to be done in groups, each group working independently on same projects
- 60% Final project to be done in groups : you will choose a topic with our agreement
    - 15% Presentation of a background paper 
    - 15% Results accomplished (how hard it was, how far you got)
    - 15% Presentation of results 
    - 15% Final report

# Content

In this course we introduce formal verification as a principled approach for developing systems that do what they should do.

The course has two aspects:
- learning the practice of formal verification - how to use tools to construct verified software
- understanding the principles behind formal verification and the ways in which verification tools work

The course will follow a similar structure to the [2020 edition](https://lara.epfl.ch/w/fv20/top). The grading will be based only on project work. Project can be a case study in developing a verified piece of software, an implementation of verification tool functionality, or a theoretical result about verification, constraint solving or theorem proving. Students present their projects with a written report as well as by a live presentation of the background material and project results, answering our questions.
